Figures and calculations on this site are generated with Winnow, a custom scripting language built specifically for Mathlib.

## Motivation

As an undergraduate, I spent hours writing and rewriting notes. Because of my major -- philosophy, focusing on mathematical logic -- my notes comprised more symbols and geometries than prose and doodles. I'm not an artist, but I am a stickler for perfection (within reason). This led me to rewriting my notes in LaTeX and redrawing diagrams in Inkscape; a cumbersome process consuming many, many hours.

I faced the classic economic tradeoff: Do I spend those hours generating perfect notes or reviewing the notes I already had? Winnow is my attempt at meeting these two endpoints halfway -- set a few of those hours for generating perfect notes and the remaining hours for review.

To reach this midpoint, I defined a scripting language and implemented its interpreter. This documentation page serves two purposes: (1) documenting the language's features, and (2) recording the process of implementing Winnow.

## Error Handling

All errors in Winnow will be classified by a type:

```ts
type ErrorType =
  | "lexical-error"
  | "syntax-error"
  | "type-error"
  | "runtime-error"
  | "resolver-error"
  | "environment-error"
  | "algebraic-error";
```

Each of these types map to an error for a specific interpretation phase.

| Error Type          | Semantic                                 |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `lexical-error`     | An error during scanning.                |
| `syntax-error`      | An error during parsing.                 |
| `type-error`        | An error during type-checking.           |
| `runtime-error`     | An error during execution.               |
| `resolver-error`    | An error during name binding resolution. |
| `environment-error` | An error during name environment lookup. |
| `algebraic-error`   | An error during an algebraic operation.  |

With these types defined, we can now implement the `Erratum` object:

```ts
class Erratum extends Error {
  message: string;
  errorType: ErrorType;
  phase: string;
  line: number;
  column: number;
  constructor(
    message: string,
    errorType: ErrorType,
    phase: string,
    line: number,
    column: number,
    fix: string = "none"
  ) {
    super(message);
    this.message = message;
    this.errorType = errorType;
    this.phase = phase;
    this.line = line;
    this.column = column;
  }
  report() {
    return formattedError(
      this.message,
      this.phase,
      this.errorType,
      this.line,
      this.column
    );
  }
}
```

The function `formattedError` returns the erratum as a pretty-print string:

```ts
/** Ensures all errors have the same format. */
function formattedError(
  message: string,
  phase: string,
  errorType: ErrorType,
  line: number,
  column: number
) {
  let moduleName = "module";
  switch (errorType) {
    case "lexical-error":
      moduleName = "scanner";
      break;
    case "algebraic-error":
      moduleName = "algebraic tree transfomer";
      break;
    case "environment-error":
      moduleName = "environment";
      break;
    case "resolver-error":
      moduleName = "resolver";
      break;
    case "runtime-error":
      moduleName = "interpreter";
      break;
    case "syntax-error":
      moduleName = "parser";
      break;
    case "type-error":
      moduleName = "typechecker";
  }
  return `${errorType.toUpperCase()}.\nWhile ${phase}, an error occurred on\nline ${line}, column ${column}.\nReporting from the ${moduleName}:\n${message}`;
}
```

Now we define custom functions to return specific errors:

```ts
/** Returns a new error making function. */
const errorFactory =
  (errtype: ErrorType) =>
  (message: string, phase: string, token: Token, fix: string = "none") =>
    new Erratum(message, errtype, phase, token.line, token.column);

/** Returns a new lexical error. A lexical error is raised if an error occured during scanning. */
const lexicalError = errorFactory("lexical-error");

/** Returns a new syntax error. A syntax error is raised if an error occured during parsing. */
const syntaxError = errorFactory("syntax-error");

/** Returns a new runtime error. A runtime error is raised if an error occured during interpretation. */
const runtimeError = errorFactory("runtime-error");

/** Returns a new environment error. An environment error is raised if an error occured during an environment lookup. */
const envError = errorFactory("environment-error");

/** Returns a new resolver error. A resolver error is raised if an error occured during resolution. */
const resolverError = errorFactory("resolver-error");

/** Returns a new algebra error. An algebra error is raised if an error occured during a symbolic operation. Because symbolic operations are handled by the symbol engine, these errors must be handled separately. */
const algebraError = errorFactory("algebraic-error");
```

We will use these functions extensively throughout the source code.

## Tokenization

Winnow begins by grouping chunks of text into tokens. Each token has a specific type. In TypeScript, we implement this with an enum:

```ts
enum TokenType {
  // single-character tokens
  left_paren,
  right_paren,
  left_brace,
  right_brace,
  left_bracket,
  right_bracket,
  comma,
  dot,
  minus,
  plus,
  semicolon,
  slash,
  star,
  colon,
  ampersand,
  caret,
  percent,

  // one or two character tokens
  bang,
  bang_equal,
  equal,
  equal_equal,
  greater,
  greater_equal,
  less,
  less_equal,

  // literals
  identifier,
  string,
  integer,
  float,

  // keywords
  and,
  class,
  else,
  false,
  for,
  if,
  nil,
  or,
  print,
  return,
  super,
  this,
  true,
  var,
  while,
  nan,
  inf,
  pi,
  e,
  let,
  fn,
  rem,
  mod,
  div,
  nor,
  xor,
  xnor,
  not,
  nand,

  // utility tokens
  error,
  eof,
  empty,
}
```

With the enum defined, we implement the Token as a TypeScript object:

```ts
/** An object corresponding to a token in Winnow. */
class Token {
  /** This token's type. */
  tokenType: TokenType;
  /** This token's lexeme. */
  lexeme: string;
  /** The line where this token was recognized. */
  line: number;
  literal: Primitive = null;
  constructor(tokenType: TokenType, lexeme: string, line: number) {
    this.tokenType = tokenType;
    this.lexeme = lexeme;
    this.line = line;
  }
  /** Sets this token's literal value to the given primitive, and returns this. */
  lit(value: Primitive) {
    this.literal = value;
    return this;
  }
  /** Returns true if this token is of the given type. */
  isType(type: TokenType) {
    return this.tokenType === type;
  }
  /** Returns a string representation of this token. */
  toString() {
    const type = TokenType[this.tokenType];
    const lexeme = this.lexeme;
    const line = this.line;
    return `[${type} | ${lexeme} | ${line}]`;
  }
}
```

Notice the type `Primitive`. This is a custom type defined as follows:

```ts
type Primitive = string | number | boolean | null;
```

We will define some constructor functions to help us quickly create tokens. First, a function that returns a new token:

```ts
const newToken = (
  type: TokenType,
  lexeme: string,
  line: number,
  column: number
) => new Token(type, lexeme, line, column);
```

and a function that returns an empty token:

```ts
const emptyToken = () => newToken(TokenType.empty, "", -1, -1);
```

Now we will write some helper functions for scanning. First, a function that returns true if the given string is a Latin or Greek character:

```ts
function isLatinGreek(char: string) {
  return /^[a-zA-Z_$\u00C0-\u02AF\u0370-\u03FF\u2100-\u214F]$/.test(char);
}
```

Second, a function that returns true if the given string is a math symbol:

```ts
function isMathSymbol(char: string) {
  return /^[∀-⋿]/u.test(char);
}
```

In Winnow, identifiers may comprise Latin or Greek characters or math symbols. We will use this function to test if a given string falls under either of these categories:

```ts
function isValidName(char: string) {
  return isLatinGreek(char) || isMathSymbol(char);
}
```

Next, a function that returns true if the given character is a Hindu-Arabic numeral:

```ts
function isDigit(char: string) {
  return "0" <= char && char <= "9";
}
```

We also want recognize hexadecimal, binary, and octal digits:

```ts
/** Returns true if the given string char is a hex digit. Else, returns false. */
function isHexDigit(char: string) {
  return (
    ("0" <= char && char <= "9") ||
    ("a" <= char && char <= "f") ||
    ("A" <= char && char <= "F")
  );
}

/** Returns true if the given string char is an octal digit. Else, returns false. */
function isOctalDigit(char: string) {
  return "0" <= char && char <= "7";
}

/** Returns true if the given string char is a binary digit. Else, returns false. */
function isBinaryDigit(char: string) {
  return char === "0" || char === "1";
}
```

Some tokens will have a literal value. For example, the token `"17"` is of type `TokenType.integer`. There is a difference between the string `"17"` and the integer 17. Since we recognize 17 as an integer at the scanning stage, we might as well attach the numeric 17 to the Token object. Similarly, if we recognize the string `"true"` as a Boolean value, we ought to attach the Boolean `true` to the resulting object. Since the majority of tokens do not have literal values (e.g., keywords, operators, and delimiters), we set the default literal value of a token to the JavaScript `null` and assign literal values as needed with the method `lit`.

We will also define two other helpful methods: (1) `isType`, which returns true if the given type matches the object's type, and (2) `toString`, which returns a simple string representation of the token.

With all of this, we can now write the scanner. Winnow's tokenizes its input by scanning on demand. In other words, we won't scan the next token unless the parser specifically asks for the next token. This achieves two benefits. First, the alternative is to scan the entire source code, store the result in, say, an array, then feed that entire array to the parser. This is a perfectly valid approach, but it comes at the cost of memory. Second, by scanning on demand, we only do work when we truly need to.

We'll call the scanner function `Lexical`:

```ts
function lexical(source: string) {}
```

The scanner works by reading each character in the given `source` string. The `source` is the user-provided code. Because we're reading each character in the string one by one, we need pointers:

```ts
function lexical(source: string) {
  let $line = 1;
  let $column = 1;
  let $start = 0;
  let $current = 0;
  let $error: Erratum | null = null;
}
```

By convention, we will preface stateful variables with a dollar sign (`$`). What these variables do:

| Variable   |                                                                                                                               |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$line`    | A counter to keep track of which line we're on.                                                                               |
| `$column`  | A counter to keep track of which column we're on.                                                                             |
| `$start`   | A counter corresponding to the ith character in the source string where the scanner first started.                            |
| `$current` | A counter corresponding to the ith character in the source string where the scanner currently is.                             |
| `$error`   | A variable that binds to either an `Erratum` object or null. If this variable is not bound to `null`, then an error occurred. |

Now we'll write some helper functions:

```ts
function lexical(source: string) {
  let $line = 1;
  let $column = 1;
  let $start = 0;
  let $current = 0;
  let $error: Erratum | null = null;
}
```
