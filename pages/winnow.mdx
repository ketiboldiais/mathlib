Figures and calculations on this site are generated with Winnow, a custom scripting language built specifically for Mathlib.

## Motivation

As an undergraduate, I spent hours writing and rewriting notes. Because of my major -- philosophy, focusing on mathematical logic -- my notes comprised more symbols and geometries than prose and doodles. I'm not an artist, but I am a stickler for perfection (within reason). This led me to rewriting my notes in LaTeX and redrawing diagrams in Inkscape; a cumbersome process consuming many, many hours.

I faced the classic economic tradeoff: Do I spend those hours generating perfect notes or reviewing the notes I already had? Winnow is my attempt at meeting these two endpoints halfway -- set a few of those hours for generating perfect notes and the remaining hours for review.

To reach this midpoint, I defined a scripting language and implemented its interpreter. This documentation page serves two purposes: (1) documenting the language's features, and (2) recording the process of implementing Winnow.

## Functional Error Handling
Winnow places a high value on error handling. To maximize both user and developer satisfaction, we need to have specific procedures for specific types of errors. We can only do so if we separate successful and failed results. We will make this separation with functional wrappers. These wrappers are basically boxes. Any procedure that can go awry will return either a `Left` or a `Right`.    

```ts
type Either<A, B> = Left<A> | Right<B>;

class Left<T> {
  private value: T;
  constructor(value: T) {
    this.value = value;
  }
  map<A>(f: (x: never) => A): Either<T, never> {
    return this as any;
  }
  isLeft(): this is Left<T> {
    return true;
  }
  isRight(): this is never {
    return false;
  }
  unwrap() {
    return this.value;
  }
  chain<X, S>(f: (x: never) => Either<X, S>): Left<T> {
    return this;
  }
}
const left = <T>(x:T) => new Left(x);

class Right<T> {
  private value: T;
  constructor(value: T) {
    this.value = value;
  }
  map<X>(f: (x: T) => X): Either<never, X> {
    return new Right(f(this.value));
  }
  isLeft(): this is never {
    return false;
  }
  isRight(): this is Right<T> {
    return true;
  }
  unwrap() {
    return this.value;
  }
  chain<N, X>(f: (x: T) => Either<N, X>): Either<never, X> {
    return f(this.value) as Either<never, X>;
  }
}
const right = <T>(x:T) => new Right(x);
```

Above, we see some duplicated method names with differing return values. For example, in `Left<T>`, we almost always return `this`, but in `Right<T>`, we return actual substantive values. We do this to ensure we always have the same basic methods, or actions, available, regardless of whether we obtain a failed or successful result.

Now that we have these wrappers, we can begin writing the tokenizer.

## Tokenization
Tokenization is the process of breaking up a string of code into smaller, well-defined chunks of characters called _tokens_. What constitutes "well-defined" is up to us as the designers of the language. For example, in Winnow, the code `1 + 1` comprises three well-defined tokens: `1`, `+`, and `1`. The code `"hello"` comprises a single token, corresponding to a string value `hello`. 

For tokens to be well-defined, we must remove ambiguity. We must be able to distinguish between `"hello"` (use of quotations) and `hello`. In Winnow, a string of code surrounded by double quotes denotes a string value. Absent those quotes, it is a variable name (or identifier), but only if that name is not a keyword. To distinguish between all these possibilites, we categorize the tokens into _token types_.

### Token Types
Winnow implements its token types with an enum:

```ts
enum TOKEN_TYPE {
  // Utility tokens
  END, ERROR, EMPTY,
  // Paired Delimiters
  LEFT_PAREN, RIGHT_PAREN,
  LEFT_BRACE, RIGHT_BRACE,
  LEFT_BRACKET, RIGHT_BRACKET,
  // Single Delimiters
  SEMICOLON, COLON,
  DOT, COMMA,
  // Operator Delimiters
  PLUS, MINUS, STAR,
  SLASH, CARET, PERCENT,
  BANG, AMPERSAND, TILDE,
  VBAR, EQUAL, LESS,
  GREATER, LESS_EQUAL, GREATER_EQUAL,
  BANG_EQUAL, EQUAL_EQUAL, PLUS_PLUS,
  MINUS_MINUS, STAR_STAR,
  // Vector Operators
  DOT_ADD, DOT_STAR, DOT_MINUS,
  DOT_CARET, AT,
  // Literals
  SYMBOL, STRING, BOOLEAN,
  INTEGER, FLOAT, FRACTION,
  SCIENTIFIC, BIG_NUMBER, BIG_FRACTION,
  NAN, INF, NIL,
  NUMERIC_CONSTANT, ALGEBRAIC,
}
```
Now that we have the token types, we can define a `Token` class for creating tokens:  

```ts
/** An object corresponding to a token in Winnow. */
class Token<T extends TOKEN_TYPE = TOKEN_TYPE, L extends PRIMITIVE = PRIMITIVE> {
  /** This token's type. */
  $type: T;
  /** This tokene's lexeme. */
  $lexeme: string;
  /** This token's literal value, if any (defaults to null). */
  $literal: L = null as any; 
  /** The line where this token was first encountered. */
  $line: number;
  /** The column where this token was first encountered. */
  $column: number;
  constructor(type: T, lexeme: string, line: number, column:number) {
    this.$type = type;
    this.$lexeme = lexeme;
    this.$line = line;
    this.$column = column;
  }
  copy() {
    return new Token(
      this.$type, 
      this.$lexeme,
      this.$line,
      this.$column,
    )
  } 
  /**
   * Returns a copy of this token with a new token type.
   * @param tokenType The new token type.
   * @returns A copy of this token with the given token type.
   */
  withType<X extends TOKEN_TYPE>(tokenType: X) {
    const out = this.copy();
    out.$type = tokenType as any;
    return out as any as Token<X, L>;
  }
  /**
   * Returns a copy of this token with a new lexeme.
   * @param lexeme The new lexeme, a string value.
   * @returns A copy of this token with the given string as its lexeme.
   */
  withLexeme(lexeme:string) {
    const out = this.copy();
    out.$lexeme = lexeme;
    return out;
  }
  /**
   * Returns a copy of this token with a new literal value.
   * @param primitive The new literal value, a Primitive.
   * @returns A copy of this token with the given literal as its literal.
   */
  withLiteral<L2 extends PRIMITIVE>(primitive: L2) {
    const out = this.copy();
    out.$literal = primitive;
    return out as any as Token<T, L2>;
  }
  /**
   * Returns a copy of this token with a new line number.
   * @param line The new line number.
   * @returns A copy of this token with the given line as its line number.
   */
  withLine(line:number) {
    const out = this.copy();
    out.$line = line;
    return out;
  }
  /**
   * Returns a copy of this token with a new column number.
   * @param column The new column number.
   * @returns A copy of this token with the given column as its column number.
   */
  withColumn(column:number) {
    const out = this.copy();
    out.$column = column;
    return out;
  }
}
```
Notice that we have a special type, called `Primitive`. This type is defined as follows: 

```ts
/** A value native to Winnow. */
type PRIMITIVE = 
    number 
    | string 
    | boolean 
    | bigint 
    | null 
    | Scientific_Number 
    | Fraction;
```

This type corresponds to values that are native to Winnow. Five of these types are native to TypeScript: `number`, `string`, `null`, `boolean`, and `bigint`. Three of these types are constructed in Winnow as objects: `Err`, `Scientific_Number`, and `Fraction`. The implementations of these types can be found [here (`Err`)](#err), [here (`Scientific_Number`)](#scientific-numbers), and [here (`Fraction`)](#fractions).   

For ease of constructing new Tokens, we will write a separate constructor function:

```ts
/**
 * Returns a new Winnow token.
 * @param type The new token's type.
 * @param lexeme The new token's lexeme.
 * @param line The line where this token was first encountered.
 * @param column The column where this token was first encountered.
 * @returns A new instance of Token.
 */
function token<X extends TOKEN_TYPE>(
  type: X,
  lexeme: string,
  line: number,
  column: number
) {
  return new Token(type, lexeme, line, column);
}
```

## Scanning
At this point, we can now write the scanner. As a preview, enter some text below and scan:

<Terminal/>

The scanner works by moving through the source code one character at a time. That said, some tokens will comprise multiple characters (e.g., the token `!=` comprises the characters `!` and `=`). So, we need two pointers: One pointer anchored to where we start, and another pointer that keeps moving forward. We also want counters to keep track of which line and column we're on within the source code. That way, when an error occurs, we can report both the `$line` and `$column` number where that error occurred. We'll call our scanning function `lexical`: 

```ts
function lexical(code: string) {
  /**
   * A variable corresponding to the
   * current line the scanner's on.
   */
  let $line: number = 1;

  /**
   * A variable corresponding to the
   * current column the scanner's on.
   */
  let $column: number = 1;

  /**
   * A pointer to the first character
   * of the lexeme currently being
   * scanned.
   */
  let $start: number = 0;

  /**
   * A pointer to the character currently
   * being scanned.
   */
  let $current: number = 0;
}
```
 Notice the use of dollar signs to preface variable names. We will adopt the convention that all variable names prefaced with a `$` indicate a mutable variable. This convention is adopted throughout Winnow's code base.

 Errors can occur during scanning. We want Winnow to stop immediately the moment an error occurs. At the scanning stage, that all begins on a single variable for flagging when an error occurs:

 ```ts 
  /**
   * Error indicator defaulting to null.
   * If initialized, then the scanning will cease.
   */
  let $error: null | Err = null;
 ```

 Now we'll write some functions that will come in handy later (all of this is written inside our `lexical` function):

 ```ts
   /**
   * Returns true if the scanner has reached the end
   * of code.
   */
  const atEnd = (): boolean => $current >= code.length || !isNull($error);

  /**
   * Consumes and returns the next character
   * in the code.
   */
  const tick = (): string => code[$current++];

  /**
   * Returns the code substring from $start to $current.
   */
  const slice = (): string => code.slice($start, $current);

  /**
   * Returns a new token.
   * @param type The token type.
   * @param lexeme The token's lexeme.
   * @returns A new Token.
   */
  const tkn = (type: TOKEN_TYPE, lexeme: string = ""): Token => {
    lexeme = lexeme ? lexeme : slice();
    return token(type, lexeme, $line, $column);
  };

  /**
   * Returns an error token. If called, sets the
   * mutable $error variable, causing scanning to
   * cease.
   * @param message The error message to accompany
   * the Err object.
   * @returns A new Token of type TOKEN_TYPE.ERROR.
   */
  const errorToken = (message: string): Token<TOKEN_TYPE.ERROR, Err> => {
    const errTkn = token(TOKEN_TYPE.ERROR, "", $line, $column);
    $error = lexicalError(message, $line, $column);
    return token(TOKEN_TYPE.ERROR, "", $line, $column).withLiteral($error);
  };

  /**
   * Returns the current character being scanned WITHOUT
   * moving the scanner forward.
   * @returns A 1-character string.
   */
  const peek = (): string => (atEnd() ? "" : code[$current]);

  /**
   * Returns the character just ahead of the current character
   * WITHOUT moving the scanner forward.
   * @returns A 1-character string.
   */
  const peekNext = (): string => (atEnd() ? "" : code[$current + 1]);

  /**
   * Returns the character `by` places
   * ahead of the current character
   * WITHOUT moving the scanner forward.
   * @param by The number of places to look ahead.
   * @returns A 1-character string.
   */
  const lookup = (by: number): string => (atEnd() ? "" : code[$current + by]);

  /**
   * If the provided expected string
   * matches, increments $current (moving
   * the scanner forward) and returns true.
   * Otherwise returns false without increment (
   * scanner doesn't move forward).
   * @param expectedChar A 1-character string corresponding
   * to the expected character.
   * @returns A boolean.
   */
  const match = (expectedChar: string): boolean => {
    if (atEnd()) return false;
    if (code[$current] !== expectedChar) return false;
    $current++;
    return true;
  };

  /**
   * Returns true if the current peek (the character
   * pointed at by `$current`) matches the provided
   * number. Otherwise, returns false.
   * @param char A 1-char string corresponding
   * to the expected character.
   * @returns A boolean.
   */
  const peekIs = (char: string): boolean => peek() === char;
 ```

## Scientific Numbers
Winnow supports writing scientific numbers directly. Recall that scientific numbers are defined as follows:

> Given $m \in \R$ and $n \in \Z,$ a scientific number is a number of the form ${m \times 10^n,}$ where $m$ is the _mantissa_ and $n$ is the _exponent_.

```ts
/** An object corresponding to a number of the form `m x 10^n`. */
class Scientific_Number {
  /** The mantissa in `m x 10^n`. */
  $m: number;
  /** The exponent (an integer) in `m x 10^n` */
  $n: number;
  constructor(m: number, n: number) {
    this.$m = m;
    this.$n = Math.floor(n);
  }
}

/**
 * Returns a new instance of a Scientific_Number.
 * @param m The mantissa in `m x 10^n`.
 * @param n The exponent (an integer) in `m x 10^n`.
 * @returns A new scientific number (m x 10^n).
 */
function scinum(m: number, n: number) {
  return new Scientific_Number(m, Math.floor(n));
}
```

## Fractions
Fractions are supported in Winnow natively.

```ts
/** An object corresponding to a number of the form `n/d`, where `n` and `d` are integers. */
class Fraction {
  /** The numerator of this fraction. */
  $n: number;
  /** The denominator of this fraction. */
  $d: number;
  constructor(n: number, d: number) {
    this.$n = n;
    this.$d = d;
  }
}

/**
 * Returns a new Fraction. Both arguments must be integers. 
 * If the arguments are not integers, they will be floored.
 * @param n The numerator of this fraction (must be an integer).
 * @param d The denominator of this fraction (must be an integer).
 * @returns A new instance of a fraction.
 */
function frac(n: number, d: number) {
  return new Fraction(Math.floor(n), Math.floor(d));
}
```

## Err
Errors in Winnow are implemented by the `Err` class.

```ts
type ErrorType =
  | "lexical-error"
  | "syntax-error"
  | "type-error"
  | "runtime-error"
  | "environment-error"
  | "resolver-error";

/** An object corresponding to an error in Winnow. */
class Err extends Error {
  /** This error's message. */
  message: string;
  /** This error's type. */
  $type: ErrorType;
  /** The line where this error occurred. */
  $line: number;
  /** The column where this error occurred. */
  $column: number;
  constructor(message: string, type: ErrorType, line: number, column: number) {
    super(message);
    this.message = message;
    this.$type = type;
    this.$line = line;
    this.$column = column;
  }
}
```
To ease making new errors, we'll use some error generators:

```ts
const errorFactory = (type: ErrorType) => 
  (message: string, line: number, column: number) => 
    new Err(message, type, line, column);

const lexicalError = errorFactory('lexical-error');
const syntaxError = errorFactory('syntax-error');
const typeError = errorFactory('type-error');
const runtimeError = errorFactory('runtime-error');
const environmentError = errorFactory('environment-error');
const resolverError = errorFactory('resolver-error');
```
