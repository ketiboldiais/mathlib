## Basic Logic Operations

**Definition.** Given a proposition ${p,}$ the negation of ${p}$ is "not ${p,}$" denoted:

$$
    \neg p.
$$

The truth table:

| ${p}$ | ${\neg p}$ |
| ----- | ---------- |
| T     | F          |
| F     | T          |

**Definition.** Given propositions ${p}$ and ${q,}$ the conjunction of ${p}$ and ${q}$ is "${p}$ and ${q,}$" denoted

$$
    p \land q.
$$

The truth table:

| ${p}$ | ${q}$ | ${p \land q}$ |
| ----- | ----- | ------------- |
| T     | T     | T             |
| T     | F     | F             |
| F     | T     | F             |
| F     | F     | F             |
